# 🛒 Favorites & Unique Products Feature

This project is a dynamic frontend feature that allows users to add items to a **Favorites Section** while displaying only **unique products** from a given dataset. It mimics real-world e-commerce functionality and demonstrates practical use of DOM manipulation, filtering logic, and state handling in JavaScript.

## 📄 Description

This project showcases the core functionality commonly found in online shopping platforms, where users can mark products as favorites and view them separately. It also ensures that only **unique products** are displayed, avoiding duplicate entries in the main listing. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and demonstrates how to manage user interactions and update the UI dynamically. It serves as a clean, scalable solution that can be integrated into larger applications or used as a standalone feature in a portfolio.
